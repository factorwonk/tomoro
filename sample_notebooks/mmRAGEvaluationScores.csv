quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal 2002 from 31% ( 31 % ) in the first quarter down to 26% ( 26 % ) in the fourth quarter .\nthis decline resulted from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal computer industry .\nthe

services , and potential changes to the company\'s product mix , including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins .\nin response to these downward pressures , the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products .\ngross margins could also be affected by the company\'s ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products .\nthe company\'s operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time ; however , the company\'s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates .\nthe company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments .\nbecause the company\'s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components .\nthe company\'s operating results and financial condition have

net sales in 2002 from 23% ( 23 % ) in 2001 .\nas discussed below , gross margin in 2001 was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of 2% ( 2 % ) experienced in the first quarter of 2001 .\nas a percentage of net sales , the company\'s quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal 2002 from 31% ( 31 % ) in the first quarter down to 26% ( 26 % ) in the fourth quarter .\nthis decline resulted from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal computer industry .\nthe company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2003 in light of weak economic conditions , flat demand for personal computers in general , and the resulting pressure on prices .\nthe foregoing statements regarding anticipated gross margin in 2003 and the general demand for personal computers during 2003 are forward- looking .\ngross margin could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors , including certain of those set forth below in the subsection entitled ""factors that may affect future results and financial condition."" there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained , targeted gross margin levels will be achieved , or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained .\nin general , gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors , including continued industry wide global pricing pressures , increased competition , compressed product life cycles , potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services , and potential changes to the company\'s product mix , including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins .\nin response to these downward pressures , the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products .\ngross margins could also be affected by the company\'s ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products .\nthe company\'s operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time ; however , the company\'s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates .\nthe company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments .\nbecause the company\'s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components .\nthe company\'s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company\'s ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns .\ngross margin declined to 23% ( 23 % ) of net sales in 2001 from 27% ( 27 % ) in 2000 .\nthis decline resulted primarily from gross margin of negative 2% ( 2 % ) experienced during the first quarter of 2001 compared to 26% ( 26 % ) gross margin for the same quarter in 2000 .\nin addition to lower than normal net .\n |

related rates paid , and noninterest-bearing sources of funding .\nsee statistical information 2013 analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest ( unaudited ) income and average consolidated balance sheet and net interest analysis in item 8 of this report for additional information .\nthe 31% ( 31 % ) increase in net interest income for 2008 compared with 2007 was favorably impacted by the $ 16.5 billion , or 17% ( 17 % ) , increase in average interest-earning assets and a decrease in funding costs .\nthe 2008 net interest margin was positively affected by declining rates paid on deposits and borrowings compared with the prior year .\nthe reasons driving the higher interest-earning assets in these comparisons are further discussed in the balance sheet highlights portion of the executive summary section of this item 7 .\nthe net interest margin was 3.37% ( 3.37 % ) for 2008 and 3.00% ( 3.00 % ) for 2007 .\nthe following factors impacted the comparison : 2022 a decrease in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 140 basis points .\nthe rate paid on interest-bearing deposits , the single largest component , decreased 123 basis points .\n2022 these factors were partially offset by a 77 basis point decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets .\nthe yield on loans , the single largest component , decreased 109 basis points .\n2022 in addition , the impact of noninterest-bearing sources of funding decreased 26 basis points due to lower interest rates and a lower proportion of noninterest- bearing sources of funding to interest-earning assets .\nfor comparing to the broader market , during 2008 the average federal funds rate was 1.94% ( 1.94 % ) compared with 5.03% ( 5.03 % ) for 2007 .\nwe expect our full-year 2009 net interest income to benefit from the impact of interest accretion of discounts resulting from purchase accounting marks and deposit pricing alignment related to our national city acquisition .\nwe also currently expect our 2009 net interest margin to improve on a year-over-year basis .\nnoninterest income summary noninterest income was $ 3.367 billion for 2008 and $ 3.790 billion for 2007 .\nnoninterest income for 2008

27% ( 27 % ) 29% ( 29 % ) the decline in proportion of the average daily short-duration advances to average loans and leases is primarily due to growth in the other segments of the loan and lease

compared to the year ended december 31 , 2013 , such average advances remained low relative to historical levels , mainly the result of clients continuing to hold higher levels of liquidity .\naverage other interest-earning assets increased to $ 15.94 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 11.16 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 .\nthe increased levels were primarily the

.\naverage other short-term borrowings increased to $ 4.18 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 3.79 billion for the year ended 2013 .\nthe increase was the result of a higher level of client demand for our commercial paper .\nthe decline in rates paid from 1.6% ( 1.6 % ) in 2013 to 0.1% ( 0.1 % ) in 2014 resulted from a reclassification of certain derivative contracts that hedge our interest-rate risk on certain assets and liabilities , which reduced interest revenue and interest expense .\naverage long-term debt increased to $ 9.31 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 8.42 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 .\nthe increase primarily reflected the issuance of $ 1.5 billion of senior and subordinated debt in may 2013 , $ 1.0 billion of senior debt issued in november 2013 , and $ 1.0 billion of senior debt issued in december 2014 .\nthis is partially offset by the maturities of $ 500 million of senior debt in may 2014 and $ 250 million of senior debt in march 2014 .\naverage other interest-bearing liabilities increased to $ 7.35 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 6.46 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 , primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our enhanced custody business .\nseveral factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin , including the mix of client liabilities ; actions of various central banks ; changes in u.s .\nand non-u.s .\ninterest rates ; changes in the various yield curves around the world ; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards , or interpretations of those standards ; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio ; and the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured .\nbased on market conditions and other factors , we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities , such as u.s .\ntreasury and agency securities , municipal securities , federal agency mortgage-backed securities and u.s .\nand non-u.s .\nmortgage- and asset-backed securities .\nthe pace at which we continue to reinvest and the types of investment

interest margin was 3.37% ( 3.37 % ) for 2008 and 3.00% ( 3.00 % ) for 2007 .\nthe following factors impacted the comparison : 2022 a decrease in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 140 basis points .\nthe rate paid on interest-bearing deposits , the single largest component , decreased 123 basis points .\n2022 these factors were partially offset by a 77 basis point decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets .\nthe yield on loans , the single largest component , decreased 109 basis points .\n2022 in addition , the impact of noninterest-bearing sources of funding decreased 26 basis points due to lower interest rates and a lower proportion of noninterest- bearing sources of funding to interest-earning assets .\nfor comparing to the broader market , during 2008 the average federal funds rate was 1.94% ( 1.94 % ) compared with 5.03% ( 5.03 % ) for 2007 .\nwe expect our full-year 2009 net interest income to benefit from the impact of interest accretion of discounts resulting from purchase accounting marks and deposit pricing alignment related to our national city acquisition .\nwe also currently expect our 2009 net interest margin to improve on a year-over-year basis .\nnoninterest income summary noninterest income was $ 3.367 billion for 2008 and $ 3.790 billion for 2007 .\nnoninterest income for 2008 included the following : 2022 gains of $ 246 million related to the mark-to-market adjustment on our blackrock ltip shares obligation , 2022 losses related to our commercial mortgage loans held for sale of $ 197 million , net of hedges ,

visa 2019s march 2008 initial public offering , 2022 a third quarter $ 61 million reversal of a legal contingency reserve established in connection with an acquisition due to a settlement , 2022 trading losses of $ 55 million , 2022 a $ 35 million impairment charge on commercial mortgage servicing rights , and 2022 equity management losses of $ 24 million .\nnoninterest income for 2007 included the following : 2022 the impact of $ 82 million gain recognized in connection with our transfer of blackrock shares to satisfy a portion of pnc 2019s ltip obligation and a $ 209 million net loss on our ltip shares obligation , 2022 income from hilliard lyons totaling $ 227 million , 2022 trading income of $ 104 million , 2022 equity management gains of $ 102 million , and 2022 gains

collected more cash overall related to revenues that will be recognized in subsequent periods in the current year than in fiscal 2008 .\ncash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended

financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 3773 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock ( through the employee stock purchase plan ) and $ 348 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises .\nduring fiscal 2008 , net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year was $ 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for $ 100996 , the payment of dividends of $ 24683 and $ 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities .\ncash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises .\nbeginning during fiscal 2008 , us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities .\nsince that time , these and other such developments have resulted in a broad , global economic downturn .\nwhile we , as is the case with most companies , have experienced the effects of this downturn , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity will be minimized by cash generated by recurring sources of revenue and due to our access to available lines of credit. .']","The context does not provide information about cash and cash equivalents for the years 2005 and 2006, so the percentage increase

years ended september 28 , 2002 are as follows ( in millions , except gross margin percentages ) : gross margin increased to 28% ( 28 % ) of net sales in 2002 from 23% ( 23 % ) in 2001 .\nas discussed below , gross margin in 2001 was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of 2% ( 2 % ) experienced in the first quarter of 2001 .\nas a percentage of net sales , the company\'s quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal 2002 from 31% ( 31 % ) in the first quarter down to 26% ( 26 % ) in the fourth quarter .\nthis decline resulted from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal computer industry .\nthe company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2003 in light of weak economic conditions , flat demand for personal computers in general , and the resulting pressure on prices .\nthe foregoing statements regarding anticipated gross margin in 2003 and the general demand for personal computers during 2003 are forward- looking .\ngross margin could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors , including certain of those set forth below in the subsection entitled ""factors that may affect future results and financial condition."" there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained , targeted gross margin levels will be achieved , or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained .\nin general , gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors , including continued industry wide global pricing pressures , increased competition , compressed product life cycles , potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services , and potential changes to the company\'s product mix , including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins .\nin response to these downward pressures , the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products .\ngross margins could also be affected by the company\'s ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products .\nthe company\'s operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time ; however , the company\'s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates .\nthe company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments .\nbecause the company\'s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components .\nthe company\'s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company\'s ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns .\ngross margin declined to 23% ( 23 % ) of net sales in 2001 from 27% ( 27 % ) in 2000 .\nthis decline resulted primarily from gross margin of negative 2% ( 2 % ) experienced during the first quarter of 2001 compared to 26% ( 26 % ) gross margin for the same quarter in 2000 .\nin addition to lower than normal net .\n | 2002 | 2001 | 2000\nNet sales | $5,742 |
